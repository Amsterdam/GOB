# Contributing

We appreciate your input, enjoy feedback and welcome improvements to this project and are very open to collaboration.

We love issues and pull requests from everyone.

## Problems, suggestions and questions in Issues

You don't need to change any of our code or documentation to be a contributor.
Please help development by reporting problems, suggesting changes and asking questions.
To do this, you can [create a GitHub Issue](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-issue/) for this project in the issues section of any of our GOB projects..

## Documentation and code in Pull Requests

If you want to add to the documentation or code of one of our projects you should push a branch and make a Pull Request.
If you never used Github, get up to speed by reading about the [GitFlow](https://datasift.github.io/gitflow/IntroducingGitFlow.html).

## GDPR

The projects within GOB partly deal with data of individuals.
This data needs thorough protection measures.
The GOB projects need to adhere to the [General Data Protection Regulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation).

Secure coding is an inherent part of all of the GOB projects.
Our secure coding guidelines will soon be made part of the [Open Source contribution guides](https://amsterdam.github.io/guides/) of the City of Amsterdam.

If you need to know more about secure coding please have a look at [Guidance - Make things secure](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/make-things-secure) of the UK Government.
 
### 1. Make your changes

When you've forked this repository, please make sure to create a feature branch following the GitFlow model.

Add your changes in commits [with a message that explains them](https://robots.thoughtbot.com/5-useful-tips-for-a-better-commit-message).

Document choices or decisions you make in the commit message, this will enable everyone to be informed of your choices in the future.

If you are adding code, make sure you've added and updated the relevant documentation and tests before you submit your Merge Request.
Make sure to write tests that show the behaviour of the newly added or changed code.

Please read our [contribution guides](https://amsterdam.github.io/guides/) if you are planning to contribute to any of our projects.
In these guides you will find extensive information about our coding standards and principles.

### 2. Pull Request

When submitting the Merge Request, please accompany it with a description of the problem you are trying to address and the issue numbers that this Merge Request fixes/addresses.

### 3. Improve

All contributions have to be reviewed by someone.

It could be that your contribution can be merged immediately by a maintainer.
However, usually, a new Merge Request needs some improvements before it can be merged.
Other contributors (or our automatic testing system Jenkins) might have feedback.
If this is the case the reviewing maintainer will help you improve your documentation and code.

If your documentation and code have passed human review and have passed the automated tests, it will be rebased onto the develop branch.

### 4. Celebrate

Your ideas, documentation and code have become an integral part of this project. You are the Open Source hero we need.

For more information on how to use and contribute to this project, please read the [`README`](README.md).
